WeatherNowCast üå¶Ô∏è
==================

Welcome to **WeatherNowCast**, a cool little web app I built to give you real-time weather updates! Just type in any location, and you'll instantly get the current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Features
--------

-   **Real-Time Weather**: Just enter a city or place, and you'll see the current weather instantly.
-   **Weather Icons**: The app automatically updates with the right weather icon (rain, sun, clouds---you name it!).
-   **Weather Details**: Gives you temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for any location.
-   **Error Message**: If you enter something that doesn't exist, you'll get a friendly "Oops! Invalid location" message.
